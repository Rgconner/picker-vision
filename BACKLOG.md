# Picker Vision — Enhancement Backlog

> **Phase 1 of the Guided Lite Mode is complete** — auth, management UI, cart types, user CRUD, product locations, and config endpoints are all shipped. Phases 2 and 3 are tracked below.


> Future work items captured during development. Ordered roughly by priority within each section.
> Move items to a plan doc (see `*-plan.md` files) when work is scheduled.

## Integrations

### IBM Sterling OMS — Order Management System
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** ~5–8 days  
**Branch target:** `feature/oms-integration`

Replace the local SQLite seed data with IBM Sterling OMS as the live source of orders, products, and stock.

**Architecture note:** The swap point already exists. [`order_service/adapters/sap_adapter.py`](server/order_service/adapters/sap_adapter.py) is a complete stub implementing [`BaseAdapter`](server/order_service/adapters/base_adapter.py). Switching is a single env var (`USE_SAP_ADAPTER=true`) once the adapter is implemented.

**Work items:**
1. IBM IAM OAuth 2.0 wiring — `client_id`/`client_secret` → bearer token + refresh in `SapAdapter.__init__`
2. Order shape mapping — flatten Sterling's nested `OrderLines.OrderLine[].Item` JSON into the picker-vision [`Order`/`OrderLine` schema](server/order_service/models.py)
3. Product/item lookup — Sterling uses `ItemID`/`UnitOfMeasure` as the key; may need a barcode cross-reference query
4. Staging/location model — map OMS `ShipNode`/`Slot` (or custom location attributes) to the 4-letter staging code scheme
5. Write-back alignment — business decision needed: per-scan pick event vs. batch at order completion; handle short picks and exceptions
6. Polling vs. push — decide whether to poll OMS on demand (fine for low volume) or subscribe to OMS webhook/event notifications for new order arrivals

**K8s config change needed (order-service deployment):**
```yaml
env:
  - name: USE_SAP_ADAPTER
    value: "true"
  - name: OMS_BASE_URL
    value: "https://<your-oms-instance>.ibm.com"
  - name: OMS_CLIENT_ID
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: oms-credentials, key: client_id }
  - name: OMS_CLIENT_SECRET
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: oms-credentials, key: client_secret }
```

## Lite Mode — Phase 2: AI Decision Layer
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** ~10–14 days
**Branch target:** `feature/lite-mode-ai`

Add the AI adaptation layer on top of the Phase 1 workflow foundation. See `lite-mode-design-spec` (Management → AI Settings) for full detail.

**Work items:**
1. `SessionMetrics` store — per-session picks, errors, zone error counts, ambient noise estimate, voice fail rate
2. Ambient noise monitoring — mic energy level via Web Audio API → feed into AI voice-mode decision
3. `SpeechRecognition` voice commands — opt-in, Chrome/Android native, auto-suspend on noise
4. Scan-mandatory vs fast-path AI decision — server-side rule engine using `SessionMetrics`
5. Validation threshold AI adjustment — tighten/relax N based on zone error rate
6. Validation method AI selection — camera sweep vs verbal count vs tap-count
7. Supervisor dashboard — threshold overrides, live session metrics panel

## Lite Mode — Phase 3: Route Optimisation & Batching
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** ~12–16 days
**Branch target:** `feature/lite-mode-routing`

Full warehouse-intelligence layer. Depends on Phase 2 SessionMetrics being in place.

**Work items:**
1. Route optimisation — location-sorted pick sequence with dynamic re-routing around congestion
2. Congestion map — active picker count per section (Redis-backed, updated on each session event)
3. Cart bin-pack at session start — weight + volume optimisation against CartType limits
4. AI batch-mode selection — single vs multi-order per cart run based on session conditions
5. IBM OMS integration — when available (see IBM Sterling OMS entry above)
6. Dock scan auto-confirm — auto-complete cart return on staging area QR scan
